# north-korea-missiles

An analysis of North Korean missile launches, including tests, using R Markdown.

This R Markdown Notebook aims to explore the public North Korean missile test dataset. It aims to not only conduct an analysis, but to be educational to the reader and explain the steps taken.

## The data

The data was obtained from the [James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS)](https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/cns-north-korea-missile-test-database/). The data is saved in two seperate though related CSV files being one for the actual missile tests (`Missile_Tests.csv`) and one containing more details of the facilities (`Facilities.csv`). Details and explanations of the data is explained further in the R Markdown notebook.

## The focus

The focus of this analysis was to conduct a motivated exploratory data analysis driven by curiosity. It was primarily graphical data analysis in nature, and of course featured a range of data cleaning up front.

The R Markdown file (`nk_missile_tests_example.Rmd`) contains the actual R code blocks and markdown commentary. The PDF file (`nk_missile_tests_example.pdf`) contains a published version of the Notebook aimed more for presentation and consumption by end users.

The project ended with a light example of modelling, and there is no intent to continue working on this as I have achieved everything I intended with this project. It was a thoroughly enjoyable dataset to explore.
